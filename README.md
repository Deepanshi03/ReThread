### Target Problem To Be Solved

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often find their wardrobes cluttered with clothes that are no longer in use. These clothes take up valuable space and leave the owners unsure of how to dispose of them in a profitable and environmentally friendly manner. 
<br>
On the other hand, there are individuals who are unable to afford new clothes due to high market prices. The challenge is to bridge this gap and create a platform where owners can sell their pre-owned clothes, thereby decluttering their wardrobes and earning money, while buyers can purchase these clothes at reduced rates. This not only promotes sustainable living but also makes fashion more accessible and affordable. 
<br>
Thus problem to be solved is, the lack of a user-friendly, trustworthy, and efficient platform for selling and buying pre-owned clothes.

### Methodology to be Adopted to Solve the Problem

To solve the above problem, we can create a platform, where users can sell their pre-owned clothes and make money, while others can get clothes at affordable rates.
<br> 

**Steps for Implementing the Solution:**

1. **Platform Development**: Develop a user-friendly website that allows individuals to list their pre-owned clothes for sale. The platform should be easy to navigate and have features like user profiles, product listings, and a secure payment gateway.

2. **Quality Check**: Implement a system to ensure the quality of the listed items. This could involve a verification process for each item listed on the platform.

3. **User Engagement**: Encourage users to list their unused clothes by making the process simple and rewarding. This could involve offering incentives for listing items or providing tips on how to price and present items for sale.

4. **Marketing and Outreach**: Promote the platform to potential users through various channels such as social media, email newsletters, and partnerships with fashion influencers or bloggers.

5. **Customer Support**: Provide excellent customer service to handle any queries or issues that arise. This could involve setting up a help center on the website and providing timely responses to user inquiries.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly gather feedback from users and use this information to improve the platform. This could involve making updates to the website design, adding new features, or improving the quality check process.

By following this methodology, the company can effectively address the problem of unused clothes piling up in cupboards. Not only does this provide a solution for individuals looking to declutter their wardrobes, but it also offers a sustainable and affordable option for those looking to buy clothes.
